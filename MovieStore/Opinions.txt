I didn't mind this refactor at all.
I think it was a fairly good refactor, although I am generally not a fan of the way
the statement class is used within customer.

Since we need to pass the customer into the statement, the UML for the customer looks cumbersome.
The Customer owns a Statement, but then the Statement needs to then own the same Customer?
It would make for more sense for statements to exist in isolation.

The Statement shouldn't be owned by anything, and the Statement owns the customer that the statement is about.
That would remove the cumbersomeness around setting a statement, and then also separate the concerns a bit,
making the Statement class act more like a service class,
rather than a thing that is directly associated with the Customer's data.
